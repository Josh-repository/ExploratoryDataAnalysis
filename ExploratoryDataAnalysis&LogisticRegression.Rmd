Data set is taken from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset


#Problem Statement:

The objective of the project is to predict whether the customer defaults 
or not using logistic regression model and check the accuracy of the 
model after performing data cleaning and exploratory analysis on the 
data.The given dataset contains information on default payments, 
credit data, demographic factors, payment history, and bill statements 
of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

#Exploratory data analysis
-The data set has 29999 observations with 25 dimensions of 
which 11 are discrete and 14 are continuous variables in which we
removed the ID column which doesnt provide any significance to
the model building.
-There are no missing values in the dataset 
- Out of 29999 observations, 6636 i.e. 22% are defaulters 
and remaining 23364 (78%) are non-defaulters

# Chi Square Test – Default Vs. first three categorical variables
Checked the significance and probalabilties of first three 
catagoerical variables GENDER ,Education,Maritial status with 
Default numerical variable

# Correlation between numeric variables:
Checked the correlation of the numeric variables and found strong
correlation for the BillAMT_APR to BILLAMT_SEP.

#Library GGally:
The R package 'ggplot2' is a plotting system used for 
visualisation of the data.
'GGally' extends 'ggplot2' by adding several functions to reduce 
the complexity of combining geometric objects with transformed data

#Ggcorr 
- used to Plot A Correlation Matrix With Ggplot2

#Usage:
ggcorr(
  data,
  method = c("pairwise", "pearson"),
  cor_matrix = NULL,
  nbreaks = NULL,
  digits = 2,
  name = "",
  low = "#3B9AB2",
  mid = "#EEEEEE",
  high = "#F21A00",
  midpoint = 0,
  palette = NULL,
  geom = "tile",
  min_size = 2,
  max_size = 6,
  label = FALSE,
  label_alpha = FALSE,
  label_color = "black",
  label_round = 1,
  label_size = 4,
  limits = c(-1, 1),
  drop = is.null(limits) || identical(limits, FALSE),
  layout.exp = 0,
  legend.position = "right",
  legend.size = 9,
  ...
)

#Example:
ggcorr(df, hjust =.9, size = 4, low = "black", mid = "steelblue4", 
       high = "red", layout.exp = 2,geom = "circle")

#Arguments:
df-a data frame or matrix containing numeric (continuous) data.

hjust-controls horizontal justification for value of 0.9 its right
justified

low-the lower color of the gradient for continuous scaling of 
the correlation coefficients.black color for -1.0 correlation 
value
mid-the midpoint color of the gradient for continuous scaling of 
the correlation coefficients.steelblue color for 0 correlation.

high-the upper color of the gradient for continuous scaling of the 
correlation coefficients.Red for high correlation value of 1.0
layout.
exp-a multiplier to expand the horizontal axis to the left if 
variable names get clipped
geom-the geom object to use circles to represent the data in 
the form of circles.

#Results:
Good correlation plot of of my numerical data representing which
variables are with high, low and mid correlation values with their 
corresponding colors.
The added advantage is that function automatically
it ignores data in column(s) 'GENDER', 'EDUCATION', 
'MARITAL_STATUS', 'REPAY_SEP', 'REPAY_AUG', 'REPAY_JUL', 
'REPAY_JUN', 'REPAY_MAY', 'REPAY_APR', 'DEFAULT' which are not 
numeric 


```{r}

library("GGally")
ggcorr(df, hjust =.9, size = 4, low = "black", mid = "steelblue4", 
       high = "red", layout.exp = 2,geom = "circle")
```

#boxplot of numeric variables
A boxplot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution 
of data based on a five number summary 
(“minimum”, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3),
and “maximum”). It can tell you about your outliers and what 
their values are. It can also tell you if your data is symmetrical,
how tightly your data is grouped, and if and how your data is skewed.

From belwo we could see that for every varibale there are outliers
which may lead building a strong model for the given dataset.
We need to treat the outliers for better accuracy of the model.
```{r}

ggplot(df, aes(x=LIMIT_BALANCE)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill='yellow',colour="black",
                 outlier.color = "Red")
ggplot(df, aes(x=AGE)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill='lightblue',colour="darkred",
                 outlier.color = "Red")
ggplot(df, aes(x=BILLAMT_APR)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill='lightgreen',colour="darkred",
                 outlier.color = "Red")
ggplot(df, aes(x=BILLAMT_MAY)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill='lightgreen',colour="darkred",
                 outlier.color = "Red")
ggplot(df, aes(x=BILLAMT_JUN)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill='lightgreen',colour="darkred",
                 outlier.color = "Red")
ggplot(df, aes(x=BILLAMT_JUL)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill='lightgreen',colour="darkred",
                 outlier.color = "Red")
ggplot(df, aes(x=BILLAMT_AUG)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill='lightgreen',colour="darkred",
                 outlier.color = "Red")
ggplot(df, aes(x=BILLAMT_SEP)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill='lightgreen',colour="darkred",
                 outlier.color = "Red")

```

#Outlier Treatment of numeric variables
-From the first boxplot we could see that there are outliers in 
all variables and the outliers are fairly outside the 1%-99% range.
And the corressponding distribution is the evident that 

The outliers are treated by removing values that are greater 
than 99 percentile and lesser than 1 percentile of the total 
observations and we could see that now the distributions are improved 
and kind of normal distribution

```{r}
#Outliers Treatment

Data splitting is the partitioning available dataset into two 
portions, usually for cross validation purposes. One portion of 
the data is used to develop a predictive model and the other to 
evaluate the model's performance. 
Let us split the observations into 70/30, i.e.,
out of 100 observations 70 are used to build the model and 
30 are used to validate the model performance.

Freq_all:

Gives the Count of Non Defaulters 23364 corresponding proportion
value is 78%
the Count of Non Defaulters 6636 corresponding proportion
value is 22%

Freq_train and Freq_test gives the values it takes from the total
 values of defaulters and non defaulters for train and test data set.
 
 
#Library CaTools:
 
#Package caTools:
Contains several basic utility functions including: moving
(rolling, running) window statistic functions, read/write for
GIF and ENVI binary files, fast calculation of AUC, LogitBoost
classifier, base64 encoder/decoder, round-off-error-free sum
and cumsum, etc.

Here i Used for Splitting the dataset

#Description:
Split data from vector Y into two sets in 
predefined ratio while preserving relative ratios of different
labels in Y. Used to split the data used during classification 
into train and test subsets.

#usage:
sample.split( Y, SplitRatio = 2/3, group = NULL )

#Example:
split= sample.split(df_final$DEFAULT,SplitRatio=0.7)
train1=subset(df_final1, split==TRUE) 
test1=subset(df_final1, split==FALSE)

#Arguments:
Y-Vector of data labels,here we took df$Default as my variable
SplitRatio-We are splitting the data set into 70% for train dataset.
then one random point from Y will be set to TRUE as shown in subset of
train1.

#Results:
Splits the total data observation for default as 70% for train data
and 30% data for the test after the model is built successfully.

#Logistic Regression Model:
One of the most common, successful and transparent ways to 
do the required binary classification to “good” and “bad” is
via a logistic function. This is a function that takes as 
input the client characteristics and outputs the probability of default. 
p = exp(𝛽 0 + 𝛽1 ∙ 𝑥1 + ⋯ + 𝛽𝑛 ∙ 𝑥𝑛 )/1 + exp(𝛽 0 + 𝛽1 ∙ 𝑥1 + ⋯ + 𝛽𝑛 ∙𝑥𝑛) where in the above 
- p is the probability of default 
- xi is the explanatory factor i 
- βi is the regression coefficient of the explanatory factor i 
- n is the number of explanatory variables For each of the existing 
data points it is known whether the client has gone into default or 
not (i.e. p=1 or p=0). 
-The aim in the here is to find the coefficients β0,… , βn 
such that the model’s probability of default equals to 
the observed probability of default

#Logistic regression output:
-Builded logistic model with train data that we splitted and we
used binomial logit function to take log of the equation to find the 
coefficients.
-The negative coefficients of Education_Others, Gender_Male and 
Repayment amount implies that the customer is less likely to default 
as these values increases.

```{r}

model2<-glm(DEFAULT~.,data = train1,family = binomial("logit"), 
            maxit=100)
library(ggplot2)
summary(model2)
plot(model2)


library(caret)
varImp(model2)
```

#Confusion Matrix
To measure the performance of logistic model we use confusion matrix
which gives the accuracy of the model with newly predicted values
with the test data we splitted for and checks with repsonse variable.
We coudl see that the accuracy of the model is 
82% on validation dataset, Out of 1991 defaulters in test dataset 
of 6636, the model was able to predict 1294 as defaulters.
Hence the sensitivity of the model is just 95.8%.


```{r}
test.predicted.m2 <- predict(model2, newdata = test1, 
                             type = "response")
library(e1071)#used to perform confusion matrix of the model
confusionMatrix(factor(round(test.predicted.m2))
                ,factor(test1$DEFAULT))
```
#ROCCurve

The area under the curve summarizes this: if it is high you pay very 
little, while if it is low you pay a lot. 
The ‘ideal’ curve achieves sensitivity 1 for specificity 1, and has AUC 1. 
This implies you pay nothing in false positives for true positives.
Our observed curve is pretty good though, as it has a large 
slope early on, and a high AUC of 0.77.

```{r}

library(pROC)#used to calcualte roc value and plot it,and                          calculate AUC value of the model
predicted <- predict(model2, newdata = test1, type = "response")
roc_qda=roc(response=test1$DEFAULT, predictor= predicted, plot=TRUE)
plot(roc_qda, col="red", lwd=3, main="ROC curve")
auc_qda<-auc(roc_qda)
auc_qda#AUC value

```

#Conclusion:
From the analysis we can conclude that the following factors 
were playing major role in determining the defaulters. 
-Repayment status is highly significant
-High difference between the bill amount and the repayment amount 
- Customers who had made partial repayment are more likely to default 
- The chance of customer to default increases if the repayment is 
delayed by 2 months or more 
- Demographic variables are not significant to predict defaulters.
